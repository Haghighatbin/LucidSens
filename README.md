# LucidSens
<b>A device for electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based measurements</b><br /><br />

  There is a common agreement that the most indicative clinical procedure for rapid and early diagnosis of diseases is to monitor the concentration of specific biomarkers in the patientâ€™s analytical sample at the early stages of the incident using point-of-care (POC) technologies. Among the POC sensing devices, luminescence-based sensing methodologies have been a dominant trend in clinical procedures mostly owing to their tremendously high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity in the analysis of multiplex analytical samples. However, achieving high photosensitivity and versatility to process multiple samples in luminescence-based POC devices commonly come at a cost of compromising the affordability aspect of such sensing devices. <br /><br />To address the gap, <b>LucidSens</b>, a cost-effective luminescence-based POC sensing device is developed for highly sensitive and precise determination of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and chemiluminescence (CL)-based biological samples. While designed to be portable and cost-efficient, the device provides the versatility of operating in two operational modes: <b>incubation</b> and <b>detection</b> modes. In the incubation mode, the integrity of the process is validated and assured by a PID (proportional, integral, derivative) algorithm with a temperature-sensing feedback loop controlling the implemented Peltier heating/cooling module. In the detection mode, the system is capable of collecting ECL/CL signals of up to 18 analytical samples utilizing an implemented silicon-photomultiplier (SiPM) biased by a miniaturized onboard high-voltage power supply and built-in pseudo-potentiostat modules. The portable architecture of the device as well as remarkable photosensitivity, cost-efficiency and convenient operational instruction may propose the current platform as a versatile analytical template to be adapted for a wide range of ECL/CL-based clinical and bio-analytical determinations. <br />Designed and developed by aminhb@tutanota.com
